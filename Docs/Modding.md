## Setup Unity Explorer

If you are developing mods or want to learn how the internals of the game work and tweak them yourself I recomend installing Unity Explorer


1. Install [UnityExplorer, IL2CPP version](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer)
  - You'll want to select BepInEx BIE 6.X IL2CPP
  - Unzip the release file into a folder
  - Take the `plugins/sinai-dev-UnityExplorer` folder and place it in the games root `BepInEx/plugins/`
  - So you'll have `game root path/BepinEx/plugins/sinai-dev-UnityExplorer`
