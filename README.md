# Mission Control ðŸš€

Mission Control is set of modding tools and utilities for [Mars: First Logistics Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532200/Mars_First_Logistics/), built for the community and by the community.

âš  This softwave is experimental ALPHA, we are working towards a stable API but we are nowhere near. But right now we are just thorwing things at walls and seeing what sticks. Structure will come with time. Expect breaking changes.

## Getting Started

See the section on [Modding](/Docs/Modding.md) for more information on setting up BepinEX.

1. Install [BepinEx v6 IL2CPP](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)

  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
