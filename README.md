# Mission Control ðŸš€

Mission Control is set of modding tools and utilities for [Mars: First Logistics Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532200/Mars_First_Logistics/), built for the community and by the community.

âš  This softwave is experimental ALPHA, we are working towards a stable API but we are nowhere near. But right now we are just thorwing things at walls and seeing what sticks. Structure will come with time. Expect breaking changes.

## Getting Started

See the section on [Modding](/Docs/Modding.md) for more information on setting up BepinEX.

1. Install [BepinEx v6 IL2CPP](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be)
1. Install [UniverseLib IL2CPP](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UniverseLib)
1. Build this running `dotnet build` then copy the dll into the bepinx plugin directory. This can be be done by running `./build.ps1` 

Optional steps:

- Copy `Examples/examplebundle`, into your gamedata folder to test custom meshes and parts. This can be done manually or by running `./copy_examples.ps1`)
- If you are developing your own mod I highly suggest install [UnityExplorer, IL2CPP CoreCLR version](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer)
- If your game path is different than mine you may want to update the paths in `build.ps1` and `copy_examples.ps1`
