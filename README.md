# Mission Control ðŸš€

Mission Control is set of modding tools and utilities for [Mars: First Logistics Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532200/Mars_First_Logistics/), built for the community and by the community.

âš  This softwave is experimental ALPHA, we are working towards a stable API but we are nowhere near. But right now we are just thorwing things at walls and seeing what sticks. Structure will come with time. Expect breaking changes.

## Getting Started

TODO, Real documenation

1. Install BepinEx 6, IL2CPP
2. Install universe lib as an IL2CPP bepinex plugin
3. Install this as a bepinex plugin
4. Copy `Examples/examplebundle` into gamedata for the custom mesh!

### Features

- Asset Utils: Tools to load assets, textures, meshes
- Part Manager: Tools to import custom parts with their own meshes
  - Limitations:
    - Can import `PartSO` and `WheelSO`, other types to follow
    - Localization is broken
    - Custom meshes don't have textures / materials
    - No custom part icons yet
- Unlocks all parts and gives 999 of each for testing purposes (will remove later and move to cheat manager)

### Future Work

- Cheat Manager
- Contract Manager
- Parcel Manger
- Station Manager
