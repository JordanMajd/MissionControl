# Mission Control ðŸš€

Mission Control is set of modding tools and utilities for [Mars First Logistics Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1532200/Mars_First_Logistics/), built for the community and by the community. It can be used as a mod by itself or it can be used as a library to help create mods.

## Getting Started

### Applying the mod

There are two main requirements:
- [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases), a tool that enables modding in Unity games
- [UniverseLib](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UniverseLib), or in its defect [UnityExplorer](https://github.com/sinai-dev/UnityExplorer), which bundles the prior

For more details, please see the [Modding](/Docs/Modding.md) documentation.

### Compiling on your own

Since the project uses your game installation as the source for libraries, the same requirements as in the previous section are in place. Refer to [Installing BepInEx](/Docs/Modding.md#installing-bepinex) and [Adding UniverseLib](/Docs/Modding.md#adding-universelib) for further documentation. 

After the required installation is completed:
1. Build and copy the dll to your game by running `dotnet build /t:Deploy`
1. Copy an example parts pack to your game by running `dotnet build /t:Examples`
1. Create an `Env.props` file if your game installation path is not the default Steam path. The file should look as follows:

```
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GAME_PATH>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Mars First Logistics Demo</GAME_PATH>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
